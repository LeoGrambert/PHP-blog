This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they''re actually proud of that shit. Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I''m not a mistake! It all makes sense!
